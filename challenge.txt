The challenge is to define the constructor for the GameHandler.
I want to pass into the GH the 
1. world Structure (3composites found in constants file.)
2. the player
3. the levels
4. physics

1. world structure goes to physicshandelr
2. player goes to playerhandler
3. level goes to levelhandler
4. physics goes PhyscisHandler


REVIEW::
1.Constructors = a function that creates objects and runs once
2.Encapsulation = sending lots of parameters wrapped as one object


Challenge for today:
1.Show Player On the Screen X 
2.Apply forces to the player

TASK 1:
GOAL- pLayer to show ( player is a rectangle with a position)
Ingredients: 
1.Rectangle (X) rect() in p5
2.Player (X) playerHandler has it
3.obstacles  (X) levelData
4.positon (X) playerHandler.players
5.p5.js (X) index.html

TASK 2:
GOAL: Apply forces to the player (the player moves when we control and gravity)
INGREDIENTS:
1.Matter (gravity) () TODO learn how to apply forces
2.Player (X) playerHandler players[], physicsHandler this.engine.world.composite ID 0 
3.User controlled input (up down left right) TODO
4.p5 (renderer) (X) player fw()


TASKS 3:

-player phases through obstacles - heng 
-obstacles are the incorrect size - hsing
