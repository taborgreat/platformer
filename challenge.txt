The challenge is to define the constructor for the GameHandler.
I want to pass into the GH the 
1. world Structure (3composites found in constants file.)
2. the player
3. the levels
4. physics

1. world structure goes to physicshandelr
2. player goes to playerhandler
3. level goes to levelhandler
4. physics goes PhyscisHandler
